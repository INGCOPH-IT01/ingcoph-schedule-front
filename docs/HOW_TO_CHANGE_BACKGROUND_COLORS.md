## 🎨 Understanding the Three Colors

### Primary Background Color (White/Base)
- **What it does**: The pure color at the edges
- **Default**: `#FFFFFF` (White)
- **Tip**: Usually keep this white or very light

### Secondary Background Color (Light Tint)
- **What it does**: The light tinted areas
- **Default**: `#FFEBEE` (Very Light Red)
- **Tip**: Use a very light version of your brand color

### Accent Background Color (Center Gradient)
- **What it does**: The center of the gradient
- **Default**: `#FFCDD2` (Light Red)
- **Tip**: Use a light, but slightly bolder version of your brand color

---

## 📊 How the Gradient Works

The system creates a smooth gradient:
```
Start → Light Tint → Center → Light Tint → End
(Primary → Secondary → Accent → Secondary → Primary)
```

This creates a beautiful, subtle effect! 🌈

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
1. ✅ **Use light colors** - Backgrounds should be subtle
2. ✅ **Stay in one color family** - Red, blue, green, etc.
3. ✅ **Test readability** - Text should be easy to read
4. ✅ **Use presets first** - Great starting points!
5. ✅ **Make small adjustments** - Subtle is better

### What to Avoid:
1. ❌ **Dark backgrounds** - Text won't be readable
2. ❌ **Bright, bold colors** - Too distracting
3. ❌ **Mixing color families** - Red with blue looks odd
4. ❌ **High contrast gradients** - Should be subtle

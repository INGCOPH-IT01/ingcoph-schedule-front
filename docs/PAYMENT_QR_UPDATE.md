# Payment QR Code Update - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Changed?

### Payment QR Code Display
The BookingDetailsDialog now displays a **dynamic payment QR code** that comes from the **Payment Settings module** instead of a static file.

### Key Features:
- ✅ QR code loaded from admin-configured Payment Settings
- ✅ Real-time updates when admin changes QR code
- ✅ Displays GCash account name and number
- ✅ Shows total amount to be paid
- ✅ Loading indicator while fetching settings
- ✅ Graceful fallback if QR code not configured
- ✅ Enhanced proof of payment display with thumbnails

## 🔧 How It Works

### For Admins:
1. Go to **Payment Settings** module
2. Upload your GCash QR code image
3. Enter GCash account details
4. Save settings

### For Customers:
1. Open booking details dialog
2. See payment QR code with amount and account details
3. Scan with GCash app to pay
4. Upload proof of payment screenshot

## 📱 Where It Appears

The payment QR code shows in:
- **Booking Details Dialog** (BookingDetailsDialog.vue)
- **Payment Information section**
- **Only for unpaid bookings** (not shown for paid or rejected bookings)

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Payment QR Section:
- Centered QR code display
- Account name and number shown below QR
- Total amount chip with icon
- Scan instructions
- Upload reminder alert

### Proof of Payment Display:
- **Before:** Simple "View #1", "View #2" buttons
- **After:** Interactive thumbnail gallery with preview images
- Hover effects and smooth animations
- File count indicator

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Service Integration:
```javascript
import { paymentSettingService } from '../services/paymentSettingService'

// Loads payment settings including QR code
const settings = await paymentSettingService.getPaymentSettings()
```

### API Endpoint:
```
GET /api/company-settings

Returns:
{
  payment_qr_code: "path/to/qr-code.png",
  payment_qr_code_url: "/storage/payment-qr-codes/qr-code.png",
  payment_gcash_name: "Business Name",
  payment_gcash_number: "0917-123-4567",

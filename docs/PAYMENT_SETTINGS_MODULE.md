## How to Use

### For Admin Users

1. **Access the Payment Settings:**
   - Log in as an admin user
   - Click "Payment Settings" in the left navigation menu
   - Or navigate to `/#/admin/payment-settings`

2. **Update Payment Details:**
   - Enter your GCash Number (e.g., 0917-123-4567)
   - Enter your GCash Account Name (e.g., Perfect Smash)
   - Enter custom payment instructions for users
   - Preview how it will appear to users
   - Click "Save Payment Settings"

3. **What Users Will See:**
   - When users checkout their bookings and select GCash payment
   - They will see your configured phone number and account name
   - The GCash QR code will be generated with your details
   - Your custom payment instructions will be displayed

### For Regular Users

- No changes to the user experience
- Payment details are now dynamically loaded from admin settings
- GCash QR codes work seamlessly with configured payment info

## Security

- Payment settings management is restricted to admin users only
- Route guards prevent unauthorized access
- API endpoints require admin authentication
- Non-admin users cannot view or modify payment settings

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/company-settings` - Fetch all company settings including payment info
- `PUT /api/admin/company-settings` - Update company settings (admin only)

### Default Values
If payment settings fail to load, the system falls back to:
- GCash Number: 0917-123-4567
- Account Name: Perfect Smash
- Instructions: "Please send payment to our GCash number and upload proof of payment."

### QR Code Generation
- Automatically removes dashes from phone number for QR compatibility
- Removes spaces from account name for proper URL encoding
- Format: `gcash://pay?number=09171234567&amount=1000&name=PerfectSmash`

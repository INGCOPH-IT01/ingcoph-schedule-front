# BookingDetailsDialog Enhancement Summary

## Date: October 21, 2025
## Version: 1761033831119

## Overview
Enhanced the BookingDetailsDialog component to display dynamic payment QR code from Payment Settings and improve multiple proof of payment file handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Payment QR Code Display (Lines 541-585)
**Feature:** Added dynamic GCash payment QR code display for unpaid bookings
- **Location:** Payment Information section
- **Visibility:** Shows only for unpaid and non-rejected bookings
- **Source:** QR code loaded dynamically from Payment Settings module
- **Components:**
  - Loading state with progress indicator
  - Dynamic GCash QR code image from Payment Settings
  - Display of total amount to be paid
  - GCash account name and number from settings
  - Instructions for scanning with GCash app
  - Fallback message if QR code is not configured
  - Info alert directing users to upload proof after payment

**Implementation Details:**
```vue
<div v-if="booking.payment_status !== 'paid' && !isRejected" class="payment-qr-section mb-4">
  <v-card variant="tonal" color="primary" class="pa-4">
    <!-- Loading State -->
    <div v-if="loadingPaymentSettings">
      <v-progress-circular indeterminate color="primary"></v-progress-circular>
    </div>

    <!-- QR Code Display -->
    <div v-else-if="paymentQrCodeUrl">
      <img :src="paymentQrCodeUrl" alt="GCash Payment QR Code" />
      <v-chip>Amount: ₱{{ totalPrice }}</v-chip>
      <p>{{ paymentSettings.payment_gcash_name }}</p>
      <p>{{ paymentSettings.payment_gcash_number }}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Fallback -->
    <div v-else>
      <p>Payment QR code not available. Please contact support.</p>
    </div>
  </v-card>
</div>
```

**Integration with Payment Settings:**
- Automatically fetches payment settings when dialog opens
- Uses `paymentSettingService.getPaymentSettings()` to retrieve QR code
- Displays QR code from `payment_qr_code_url` field
- Shows payment account information for verification

### 2. Enhanced Proof of Payment Display (Lines 697-746)
**Feature:** Improved display of uploaded proof of payment files with thumbnail gallery
- **Previous:** Simple button list showing "View #1", "View #2", etc.
- **New:** Interactive thumbnail cards with preview images

**Key Improvements:**
- Visual thumbnail preview (100x100px cards)
- Hover effects with elevation changes
- Loading placeholders during image load
- Error fallback with icon display
- File count indicator
- Click to view full image
- Better mobile responsive sizing

**Implementation Details:**
```vue
<v-card
  v-for="(file, index) in getProofOfPaymentFiles(booking.proof_of_payment)"
  class="proof-thumbnail-card"
  @click="viewProofOfPayment(index)">
  <v-img :src="getProofThumbnailUrl(index)" height="100" width="100" />
</v-card>
```

### 3. Payment Settings Integration (Lines 1179-1203)

**New State Variables:**
```javascript
const paymentSettings = ref(null)
const loadingPaymentSettings = ref(false)
```

**New Methods:**

**`loadPaymentSettings()`** (Lines 1184-1194)
- Fetches payment settings from the backend using `paymentSettingService`
- Loads QR code URL, GCash account details, and payment instructions
- Handles errors gracefully with console logging
- Called automatically when dialog opens

**`paymentQrCodeUrl` computed property** (Lines 1197-1203)
- Computes full URL for payment QR code image
- Combines API base URL with the QR code path from settings
- Returns null if no QR code is configured
- Enables reactive display of payment QR code

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const loadPaymentSettings = async () => {
  try {
    loadingPaymentSettings.value = true
    const settings = await paymentSettingService.getPaymentSettings()
    paymentSettings.value = settings
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load payment settings:', error)
  } finally {
    loadingPaymentSettings.value = false
  }
}

const paymentQrCodeUrl = computed(() => {
  if (!paymentSettings.value?.payment_qr_code_url) {
    return null
  }
  const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'
  return `${apiUrl}${paymentSettings.value.payment_qr_code_url}`
})
```

### 4. Proof of Payment Thumbnail Methods (Lines 1577-1588)
**Method:** `getProofThumbnailUrl(index)`
- Generates authenticated thumbnail URLs for proof of payment images
- Handles both cart transactions and regular bookings
- Adds cache-busting timestamp parameter
- Returns full API URL with proper endpoint

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const getProofThumbnailUrl = (index) => {
  const endpoint = isTransaction.value
    ? `/cart-transactions/${props.booking.id}/proof-of-payment`
    : `/bookings/${props.booking.id}/proof-of-payment`
  return `${api.defaults.baseURL}${endpoint}?index=${index}&t=${Date.now()}`
}
```

**Method:** `handleQrCodeError(event)` (Lines 1648-1650)
- Handles errors when payment QR code image fails to load
- Logs error to console for debugging
- Allows graceful fallback display

### 5. Watch Function Update (Line 2262)
**Enhancement:** Added payment settings loading to dialog open watch
```javascript
// Load payment settings for payment QR code
loadPaymentSettings()
```
- Automatically loads payment settings whenever dialog opens
- Ensures QR code is always up-to-date with latest configuration
- Executes before booking QR code generation

### 6. CSS Styling Enhancements

#### Payment QR Code Styles (Lines 2448-2467)
```css

  margin-bottom: 16px;

}

}
```

#### Proof Thumbnail Card Styles (Lines 2469-2484)
```css
.proof-thumbnail-card {
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.proof-thumbnail-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) !important;
}
```

### 7. Mobile Responsive Enhancements

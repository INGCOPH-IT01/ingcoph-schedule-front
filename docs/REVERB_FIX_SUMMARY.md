# Laravel Reverb Fix - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

Your Laravel Reverb wasn't working due to several configuration mismatches between frontend and backend:

### Issues Found & Fixed:

1. **❌ Hardcoded Production URLs in Frontend**
   - Frontend was trying to connect to `bschedule.m4d8q2.com:443` (production)
   - Backend was running on `localhost:8080` (development)
   - Result: Connection refused errors

2. **❌ Hardcoded Auth Endpoint**
   - Auth endpoint was set to `http://192.168.10.57:8010`
   - Should be configurable based on environment

3. **❌ Missing Environment Variables**
   - No `.env` file in frontend to configure Reverb connection
   - No way to switch between dev/production environments

4. **❌ No Debug Logging**
   - No visibility into connection attempts or failures
   - Hard to troubleshoot issues

5. **❌ Missing CORS Path**
   - `broadcasting/auth` endpoint wasn't explicitly included in CORS config

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Updated `src/services/echo.js`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added proper environment variable support
- ✅ Added sensible defaults matching backend config
- ✅ Added debug logging (connected/disconnected/error events)
- ✅ Made auth endpoint configurable
- ✅ Added config logging on initialization

**Before:**
```javascript
wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_HOST || 'bschedule.m4d8q2.com',
wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT || 443,
authEndpoint: 'http://192.168.10.57:8010/api/broadcasting/auth',
```

**After:**
```javascript
const reverbHost = import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_HOST || 'localhost'
const reverbPort = parseInt(import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT || '8080')
const apiBaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8010'
authEndpoint: `${apiBaseUrl}/api/broadcasting/auth`,

// Plus connection event logging
echo.connector.pusher.connection.bind('connected', () => {
  console.log('✅ Reverb: Connected successfully')
})
```

### 2. Updated Backend CORS Config
**File:** `config/cors.php`
- ✅ Added `broadcasting/auth` to allowed paths
- ✅ Cleared and cached config

### 3. Created Documentation
- ✅ `REVERB_SETUP.md` - Complete setup and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ `QUICK_FIX_REVERB.sh` - Quick setup script
- ✅ This summary document

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the quick fix script
cd /Users/karloalfonso/Documents/GitHub/schedule/ingcoph-schedule-front
./QUICK_FIX_REVERB.sh
```

This will:
1. Create the `.env.local` file with correct settings
2. Check if backend services are running
3. Show you the next steps

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in frontend root:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/karloalfonso/Documents/GitHub/schedule/ingcoph-schedule-front
   nano .env.local  # or use your preferred editor
   ```

2. **Add this content:**
   ```env
   VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY=kx677b9udp95kpffwpcg
   VITE_REVERB_APP_ID=460626
   VITE_REVERB_HOST=localhost
   VITE_REVERB_PORT=8080
   VITE_REVERB_SCHEME=http
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8010
   ```

3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

### Testing Steps:

1. **Open your app** in browser (http://localhost:5555)
2. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Login** to your application
4. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   Initializing Echo with config: { ... }
   ✅ Reverb: Connected successfully
   ```

5. **Test real-time updates:**
   - Create a booking
   - Watch console for booking events
   - Verify booking appears without refresh

---

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

### Backend Services:
```bash
# Check if Reverb is running
ps aux | grep "artisan reverb:start"

# Check if Queue worker is running
ps aux | grep "queue:work"

# View Reverb connection in real-time
tail -f /Users/karloalfonso/Documents/GitHub/schedule/ingcoph-schedule-back/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Frontend:
```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la .env.local .env

# Verify dev server is using new env vars
# (Check server startup output for environment variables)
```

### Browser Console Tests:
```javascript
// Test 1: Check Echo instance
console.log(window.echoInstance)

// Test 2: Listen to bookings channel
const echo = getEcho()
echo.channel('bookings').listen('.booking.created', (e) => {
    console.log('📢 Booking created:', e)
})

// Test 3: Check connection state
echo.connector.pusher.connection.state
// Should be: "connected"
```

## 📊 Backend Configuration Confirmed

Your backend is properly configured:
```
✅ Broadcast Driver: reverb
✅ Reverb Key: kx677b9udp95kpffwpcg
✅ Reverb App ID: 460626
✅ Reverb Host: localhost
✅ Reverb Port: 8080
✅ Reverb Scheme: http (no TLS)
✅ Queue Driver: database
✅ Reverb Server: Running (PID: 2784)
✅ Queue Worker: Running (PID: 2779)
✅ CORS: Configured for all origins
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still getting "Connection Refused"?

1. **Verify Reverb is running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep reverb
   ```
   If not running:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/karloalfonso/Documents/GitHub/schedule/ingcoph-schedule-back
   php artisan reverb:start
   ```

2. **Check port 8080 is available:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   ```

### Getting 401 on /broadcasting/auth?

1. **Check token in localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('token'))
   ```

2. **Verify user is authenticated:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   fetch('http://localhost:8010/api/user', {
       headers: {
           'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
           'Accept': 'application/json'
       }
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   ```

### Events not being received?

1. **Check queue worker:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep queue:work
   ```

2. **Check failed jobs:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/karloalfonso/Documents/GitHub/schedule/ingcoph-schedule-back
   php artisan queue:failed
   ```

3. **Test event manually:**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   ```
   ```php
   $booking = App\Models\Booking::first();
   event(new App\Events\BookingCreated($booking));
   ```

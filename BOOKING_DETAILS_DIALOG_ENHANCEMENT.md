# BookingDetailsDialog Enhancement for Admin Support

## Overview
Enhanced the `BookingDetailsDialog` component to support both regular user booking details and comprehensive admin booking details, consolidating the booking details functionality across the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced BookingDetailsDialog Component
**File:** `src/components/BookingDetailsDialog.vue`

#### New Props
- `showAdminFeatures` (Boolean, default: false) - Enables admin-specific features like attendance management, detailed payment status, etc.
- `showCourtImages` (Boolean, default: false) - Displays court image gallery when available

#### New Features Added

##### Admin-Specific Features (when `showAdminFeatures=true`)
1. **User Information Enhancement**
   - Displays User ID
   - Shows Booking/Transaction ID

2. **Court Images Gallery**
   - Displays court images when `showCourtImages=true`
   - Uses the CourtImageGallery component
   - Error handling for failed image loads

3. **Transaction vs Booking Mode**
   - Automatically detects if booking is a transaction (cart-based)
   - Shows different sections based on booking type
   - Transaction Details section for cart transactions
   - Regular Booking Details for single bookings

4. **Cart Items Detailed View**
   - Shows detailed list of all cart items in transaction
   - Displays sport icons and colors
   - Shows court name, sport, date, time, and price for each item

5. **Frequency Booking Details**
   - Displays frequency type with color coding
   - Shows duration in months
   - Lists selected days for recurring bookings

6. **Enhanced Payment Information**
   - Payment method display with status chips
   - Payment status indicator (Complete, Missing Proof, Missing Method, Incomplete)
   - Proof of payment viewing capability
   - Download proof of payment functionality
   - Color-coded status indicators

7. **Proof of Payment Dialog**
   - Nested dialog for viewing proof of payment images
   - Full-size image display
   - Download functionality
   - Proper error handling

8. **Attendance Status Management**
   - Current attendance status display
   - Buttons to mark attendance (Showed Up, No Show, Reset)
   - Real-time updates via API
   - Emits `attendance-updated` event for parent components

#### New Methods
- `getPaymentStatusColor()` - Returns color based on payment completion status
- `getPaymentStatusText()` - Returns text description of payment status
- `getPaymentStatusIcon()` - Returns appropriate icon for payment status
- `getSportColor()` - Returns color for sport type
- `getSportIcon()` - Returns icon for sport type (from DB or fallback)
- `formatFrequencyType()` - Formats frequency type for display
- `getFrequencyColor()` - Returns color for frequency type

#### New Events
- `attendance-updated` - Emitted when attendance status is updated, passes `{ bookingId, status }`

#### Backward Compatibility
- All new props are optional with sensible defaults
- Existing usage in CourtDetail.vue and CourtDetails.vue works without changes
- When `showAdminFeatures=false`, displays basic booking information only

### 2. Updated AdminDashboard Component
**File:** `src/views/AdminDashboard.vue`

#### Changes
1. **Replaced Inline Dialog**
   - Removed the large inline booking details dialog (365+ lines)
   - Now uses the enhanced `BookingDetailsDialog` component
   - Reduced code duplication significantly

2. **Component Integration**
   ```vue
   <BookingDetailsDialog
     :is-open="detailsDialog"
     @update:is-open="detailsDialog = $event"
     :booking="selectedBooking"
     :court-name="selectedBooking?.court_name"
     :show-admin-features="true"
     :show-court-images="true"
     @attendance-updated="handleAttendanceUpdated"
   />
   ```

3. **Removed Duplicate Code**
   - Removed inline proof of payment dialog
   - Removed duplicate helper methods (now in component)
   - Removed image dialog state management
   - Removed attendance update method (now in component)

4. **New Method**
   - `handleAttendanceUpdated()` - Handles attendance update events from dialog

5. **Updated Imports**
   - Added `BookingDetailsDialog` component import
   - Removed `CourtImageGallery` import (now used by BookingDetailsDialog)

## Benefits

1. **Code Reusability**
   - Single source of truth for booking details display
   - Reduced code duplication across components
   - Easier maintenance and updates

2. **Consistency**
   - Unified booking details display across application
   - Consistent styling and user experience
   - Standardized admin features

3. **Flexibility**
   - Props allow customization for different contexts
   - Admin features can be enabled/disabled as needed
   - Backward compatible with existing implementations

4. **Maintainability**
   - Easier to fix bugs (fix once, apply everywhere)
   - Simpler to add new features
   - Reduced codebase size in AdminDashboard

## Testing Recommendations

1. **User Views (CourtDetail, CourtDetails)**
   - Verify booking details display correctly
   - Ensure no admin features are visible
   - Check that existing functionality works unchanged

2. **Admin View (AdminDashboard)**
   - Test all admin features:
     - View user information with IDs
     - View court images gallery
     - View transaction vs booking details
     - View cart items list
     - View frequency booking details
     - View and download proof of payment
     - Mark attendance status
   - Verify attendance status updates correctly
   - Test proof of payment dialog open/close
   - Test image download functionality

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Bookings without proof of payment
   - Bookings without cart items
   - Bookings with missing payment method
   - Failed image loads
   - API errors during attendance updates

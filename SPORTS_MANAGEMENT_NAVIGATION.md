# Sports Management Navigation Separation

## Overview
Added a separate navigation item for **Sports Management** in the admin sidebar to distinguish it from the public **Sports** view.

## Implementation Date
October 16, 2025

## Changes Made

### App.vue - Navigation Sidebar
**Location:** `src/App.vue` (lines 142-150)

**Added:**
```vue
<!-- Sports Management - Only for admin users -->
<v-list-item
  v-if="isAuthenticated && isAdmin"
  prepend-icon="mdi-tennis-ball"
  title="Sports Management"
  value="sports-management"
  :to="{ name: 'SportsManagement' }"
  class="excel-nav-item"
></v-list-item>
```

**Placement:** Added between "User Management" and "Company Settings" navigation items.

## Navigation Structure

### Before:
```
📊 Dashboard (All Users)
🎾 Sports (All Users)
🏟️ Courts (Admin/Staff)
📅 My Bookings (All Users)
🛡️ Admin Panel (Admin Only)
👥 User Management (Admin Only)
⚙️ Company Settings (Admin Only)
📱 Staff Scanner (Staff/Admin)
```

### After:
```
📊 Dashboard (All Users)
🎾 Sports (All Users)
🏟️ Courts (Admin/Staff)
📅 My Bookings (All Users)
🛡️ Admin Panel (Admin Only)
👥 User Management (Admin Only)
🎾 Sports Management (Admin Only) ← NEW!
⚙️ Company Settings (Admin Only)
📱 Staff Scanner (Staff/Admin)
```

## Purpose & Benefits

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Sports** (`/sports`) - Public page where users browse available sports
- **Sports Management** (`/admin/sports`) - Admin page to create, edit, and delete sports

### 2. Better User Experience
- Admin users can now easily access the Sports Management panel directly from the sidebar
- No need to navigate through the Admin Dashboard or other indirect routes
- Intuitive placement within the admin section of the navigation

### 3. Consistent Navigation Pattern
- Follows the same pattern as other admin modules:
  - User Management (admin users)
  - Company Settings (admin settings)
  - Sports Management (admin sports) ← Newly added

### 4. Visual Clarity
- Uses `mdi-tennis-ball` icon to distinguish from the general sports icon (`mdi-racquetball`)
- Clearly labeled as "Sports Management" to indicate administrative function

## Icon Selection

**Icon:** `mdi-tennis-ball`
- Represents sports/athletic activities
- Distinguishes from the public Sports view which uses `mdi-racquetball`
- Consistent with the sports theme of the application

## Route Details

**Route Name:** `SportsManagement`  
**Path:** `/admin/sports`  
**Component:** `SportsManagement.vue`  
**Access:** Admin only (protected by route guard)

## Security

- Navigation item only visible when:
  - User is authenticated (`isAuthenticated`)
  - User has admin role (`isAdmin`)
- Route is protected by `beforeEnter` guard checking admin status
- Unauthorized users are redirected to home page

## Testing Recommendations

### Admin User:
1. ✅ Login as admin
2. ✅ Check sidebar navigation
3. ✅ Verify "Sports Management" appears between "User Management" and "Company Settings"
4. ✅ Click "Sports Management" → Should navigate to `/admin/sports`
5. ✅ Verify page loads with sports CRUD functionality

### Non-Admin User:
1. ✅ Login as regular user or staff
2. ✅ Check sidebar navigation
3. ✅ Verify "Sports Management" does NOT appear
4. ✅ Try accessing `/admin/sports` directly → Should redirect to home page

### Not Authenticated:
1. ✅ Access app without logging in
2. ✅ Check sidebar navigation
3. ✅ Verify "Sports Management" does NOT appear
4. ✅ Try accessing `/admin/sports` directly → Should redirect to home page

## Files Modified
- `src/App.vue` - Added Sports Management navigation item

## Related Files
- `src/views/SportsManagement.vue` - Sports management page component
- `src/views/Sports.vue` - Public sports browsing page
- `src/router/index.js` - Route configuration (already exists, no changes needed)

## Navigation Order Logic

The navigation items are organized by user role and function:

1. **Public Section** (All Users)
   - Dashboard
   - Sports
   - My Bookings

2. **Staff/Admin Section**
   - Courts (visible to staff and admin)
   - Staff Scanner (visible to staff and admin)

3. **Admin Section** (Admin Only)
   - Admin Panel
   - User Management
   - Sports Management ← Newly added
   - Company Settings

This logical grouping makes it easy for admins to find all administrative functions in one section.

## Future Considerations

If more management modules are added (e.g., Courts Management, Bookings Management), they should follow the same pattern:
- Place in the admin section
- Use distinctive icons
- Clearly label with "Management" suffix
- Maintain consistent ordering with other admin functions
